<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
[Invite Link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=711827507241943040&permissions=8&scope=bot)

This project started out in January of 2020 and aims to provide the best tools for sneaker groups. I was in a group myself, and realized that people could truly benefit from an all in one discord bot.  

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on other things rather than looking for sneaker information
* You shouldn't have to exit the tab to look up currency conversions
* You should be able to receive push notifications directly to your phone via SMS

Of course there is a ton more that will be added to Opal in the near future. I will be making more updates and adding new features consistently as time goes on.

### Built With

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
